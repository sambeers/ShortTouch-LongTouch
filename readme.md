i feel like the future of web ui will listen for short press or long press events in favor of device specific interactions. in the meantime thoughâ€¦
this javascript captures when a user has pressed for longer than 2.5 seconds. you can change that value and add you own functions inside. currently just logs to console short touch and then long touch.
