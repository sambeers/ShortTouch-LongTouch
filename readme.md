Short Touch / Long Touch
========================

jQuery script for capturing the length of a mousedown event.


Concept
-------

I feel like in the future of web UI we will listen more often for short press or long press events in favor of user-agent specific interactions 
creating more consistent experiences across devices. 

Like making hover's work on mobile, a short-tap can start the rollover/reveal animation, while a long-press actually follows the link.

This script is pretty basic, it just captures when a user has pressed for longer than 2.5 seconds. You can change that value to something else 
and add you own functions inside. Currently it just logs to console "short touch" and then "long touch".
